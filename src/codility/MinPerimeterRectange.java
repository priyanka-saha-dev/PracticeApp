MinPerimeterRectangle - Find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals N.

An integer N is given, representing the area of some rectangle.
The area of a rectangle whose sides are of length A and B is A * B, and the perimeter is 2 * (A + B).
The goal is to find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals N.
The sides of this rectangle should be only integers.

For example, given integer N = 30, rectangles of area 30 are:

        (1, 30), with a perimeter of 62,
        (2, 15), with a perimeter of 34,
        (3, 10), with a perimeter of 26,
        (5, 6), with a perimeter of 22.

Write a function:
    def solution(N)
that, given an integer N, returns the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area is exactly equal to N.

For example, given an integer N = 30, the function should return 22, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
        N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
