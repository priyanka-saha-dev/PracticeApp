Problem Statement: Order Processing System

You are tasked to create a simple order processing system for an e-commerce platform. The system should:

Accept a list of orders, where each order contains:

Order ID (Integer)
Order Amount (Double)
Order Status (String: "NEW", "PROCESSING", "COMPLETED", or "CANCELLED")
Order Date (LocalDate)
Implement the following functionalities:

Filter Orders by Status: Write a method that filters orders based on their status and returns a list of filtered orders.
Calculate Total Amount: Write a method that calculates the total amount for orders with the status "COMPLETED".
Find Oldest Order: Write a method that finds the oldest order from the list.
Sort Orders by Date: Write a method that sorts the orders by their date in descending order.
Write test cases for the above functionalities.

Expected Features in Your Code:
Use Java 8+ features (e.g., Streams API, Optional, LocalDate).
Demonstrate good coding practices (e.g., meaningful method names, comments, and proper exception handling).
Ensure the solution is efficient and readable.
Would you like me to provide a solution template for this or focus on any specific functionality?
